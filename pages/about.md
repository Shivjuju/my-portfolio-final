# **About Me**

Hi, Iâ€™m **Siva Sai J** ðŸ‘‹<br>
Iâ€™m a driven software engineer and data enthusiast with hands-on experience in building **real-time data pipelines**, intelligent detection systems, and full-stack web applications using modern cloud-native technologies.

My recent projects involve designing modular pipelines that combine tools like **Suricata**, **Zeek**, and **Kafka**, integrated with machine learning models (Isolation Forest, XGBoost, SVM) to analyze network traffic and detect anomalies in real time. I also build interactive dashboards using **React (TypeScript)** and develop scalable microservices with **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**.

-During my internships, I contributed to:
- ðŸš€ **HiTeK Force** â€“ Recruitment platform using React, FastAPI, spaCy, Docker CI/CD
- ðŸ“¡ **Mr Dot Solutions** â€“ Geo-messaging engine with offline-first sync, Kafka-streamed delivery
