During my internship at **HiTeK Force**, I helped build a **recruitment management system**.

I worked on both frontend and backend:
- Used **React** to build recruiter dashboards
- Created FastAPI services for parsing resumes with **spaCy**
- Set up CI/CD with **GitHub Actions** and deployed on **Render**

**My biggest takeaways:**
- Writing clean, readable code matters
- Docker makes deployments easier
- Real-world teamwork is different from college projects

It gave me a lot of confidence as a developer! ðŸ’»
