While working on a real-time intrusion detection system, I got to use **Apache Kafka** and **FastAPI** together. 

Kafka helps us **stream logs from tools like Suricata and Zeek**, and FastAPI is a lightweight Python framework that handles API requests super fast.

**What I built:**
- A FastAPI service to consume logs
- A Kafka producer that pushes logs to topics
- Real-time data processing setup

**Tips for Beginners:**
- Start with local Kafka setup using Docker
- Use Pydantic in FastAPI to validate data
- Logging and error handling are crucial

This project helped me understand real-time systems and microservices better.
