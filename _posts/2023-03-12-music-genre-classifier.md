In my final year of undergrad, I explored how we can use machine learning to identify the genre of a song. ðŸŽµ

I used **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification and extracted audio features using **MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**. The model achieved about **90% accuracy** on our test data.

To make it user-friendly, I built a simple **Flask** web app where users can upload an audio file and get the predicted genre instantly. It was a fun way to apply what I learned in ML and web dev!

**Key Learnings:**
- Audio features matter a lot
- KNN is great for small datasets
- Making a project interactive helps showcase it better.
