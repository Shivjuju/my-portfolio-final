description: >
  Conducted a strategic survey under UROP at SRM University on integrating edge computing with machine learning techniques for IoT applications. Explored performance trade-offs across multiple ML algorithms (SVM, SGD, K-Means, MLP), focusing on reducing latency, enhancing accuracy, and improving bandwidth efficiency for real-time edge intelligence.
